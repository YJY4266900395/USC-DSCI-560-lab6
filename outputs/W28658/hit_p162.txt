Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement shalll be located
approximately down the east-west axis (within 250” of the section line pet Commission policy) and no closer than
200 feet to the east or west boundary within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections!7, 18, 19, & 20
T153N-R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
