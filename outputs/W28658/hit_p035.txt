Summary

1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX was initially spud for surface drilling on 13th of
September 2014 in the Indian Hills field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well
was spud by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of
10,300’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (10.3-11.4 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.8-9.9 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,548’.

3) Two 13 '4” Security PDC bits were used to drill to a depth of 6,138. 9 5/8 40# casing
was set to isolate out the upper vertical hole and maintain hole stability during curve and
lateral operations

4) One 8 %” Security PDC bit was used to drill out of secondary casing casing to a KOP of
10,300’. One 8 %” PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,190’ MD. One 6” PDC bits
were used to drill the lateral to 20,584’ TD.

5) The lateral was targeting the Three Forks member ranging from about 8’ below the base
of the Pronghorn down to approximately 1’ above the Claystone.

6) Gas levels between 500 and 4000 units were maintained through the lateral drilling
operations while in the Three Forks.

7) The Three Forks target consisted of 3 observed gross lithology. The Upper Three Forks
Pronghorn) was observed to be a gray immature claystone. The Middle Three Forks
was observed to be a dolostone with lots of disseminated pyrite and apparent
intergranular porosity. The Lower Three Forks was an off white to gray claystone

8) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

9) Drilling operations were concluded at 06:15 on January 26", 2015 at a bottom hole
location of 235.00' S & 9994.22' E of surface location or approximately 199.00' FSL &
256.93' FEL of SW SE Sec. 17, T153N-R100W.
