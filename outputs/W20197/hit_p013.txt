Summary

1) The Wade 5300 21-30H was spud 5 April 2010 east of the Indian Hill Field of McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,172’.

2) A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.7 — 9.9 ppg) after surface casing and
through the curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable
hole conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a
weight of 9.4-9.5 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic
balance.

3) One 9 5/8” PDC bit was used to drill to surface casing at a depth of 2,025’ in 9 hours. One 8
%4” PDC bit was used to drill the vertical hole from surface casing to KOP of 10,172’ in a total of
5.8 hours. One 8 4” bits was used to drill through the curve, landing at a measured depth of
11,023’ in 27 hours. The entire 9,458” lateral was drilled in 82.6 hours with one 6” PDC bits.

4) The lateral was targeting a 10’ thick section of the middle member of the Bakken
Formation situated twenty feet below the upper shale.

5) Gas levels of between 2000 and 3500 units were maintained through most of the drilling
operations. A 4-7 foot flare was maintained though most of the drilling operations

6) The Middle Bakken consisted of 2 gross lithologies. Directly below the upper Bakken Shale,
RPM geologists observed a dark gray/brown siltstone. Below this siltstone, a light grey siltstone
interbedded with light brown oil stained sandstone. The target zone consisted of light gray/
brown porous silty sandstone.

7) Hydrocarbon cuts were moderate through the entire lateral. Few slow streaming cuts were
present in target zone.

8) Drilling operations were concluded at 0115 hours on 23 APR 11 at a bottom hole location
of 23.03'S & 9971.67' E of surface location or approximately 2243.03' FNL & 311.76' FEL SE
NW Sec. 29 T153N, R1OOW

9) Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H awaits completion operations to determine ultimate
production potential.
