INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum, North America LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T well is located
approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota [Lot 1 Section
18, T153N, R1OOW]. The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T is a horizontal first bench, Three Forks
well within the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,739’ lateral drilled toward the east. The
wells surface, vertical and curve sections were previously drilled, and this evaluation will
consist of primarily operations and observations made during the lateral section.

ENGINEERING

The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T surface, vertical and curve sections were completed earlier
in 2015 by a separate drilling rig. Extreme 21 returned to location in May of 2015 to drill the
laterals of the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 3T, 3T, 2B (Figure 1). The Kline Federal 5300 11-
18 3T was re-entered on May 22, 2015. To start the lateral, a 6” Smith PDC bit, Ryan
Directional Services MWD tool, and a 1.5° adjustable Ryan Directional Services mud motor
began drilling operations. The complete bottom-hole assembly summary is tabulated as an
appendix (BHA Record) to this report. The well reached total depth at 20,840' MD at 12:45
CDT on May 28, 2015, generating an exposure of 9,739” linear feet of 6" hole through the
Three Forks target interval. The bottom-hole location (BHL) lies 875.04' south & 9,941.16'
east of surface location or approximately 1,895.04' FNL & 314.95' FEL, SE NE Section 17,
