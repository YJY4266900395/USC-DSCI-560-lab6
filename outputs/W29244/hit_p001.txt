Well File No. 29244
STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Mr. Travis:

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (Oasis) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission
— Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on May 12, 2020 an application for a Stripper Well
Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper
well pursuant to statute and rule, and Oasis has elected to designate said well as a stripper well.
The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet and was completed after June 30,
2013. During the qualifying period, December 1, 2017 through November 30, 2018, the well
produced at a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold.
The average daily production from the well was 31.6 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well” pursuant to
Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only to
the Bakken Pool in and under said well.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the

matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or

newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

e-

Petroleum Engineer
