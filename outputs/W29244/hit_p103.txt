API Rating & Safety Factor

Collapse pressure based on 11.5ppg fluid on backside and 9ppg fluid inside of casing.

Burst pressure calculated from a gas kick coming from the production zone (Bakken Pool) at
9,000psi and a subsequent breakdown at the 9-5/8” shoe, based on a 13.5#/ft fracture gradient.
Backup of 9 ppg fluid.

Yield based on string weight in 10 ppg fluid, (207k Ibs buoyed weight) plus 100k Ibs overpull.

Cement volumes are estimates based on 9-5/8" casing set in a 12-1/4" hole with 10% excess in OH and 0% excess
inside surface casing. TOC at surface.
