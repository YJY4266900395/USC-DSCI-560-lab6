1.0 INTRODUCTION

Dahl Federal 2-15H is a north lateral Middle Bakken well located NW/NE in SEC 15, T153N,
R101W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary target zone was 7’- 17’ under the top
of the Middle Bakken Formation, Although the entire Middle Bakken is considered a pay zone,
the target zone is used primarily because of its distinct gamma characteristics which are used to
help directional drill the lateral. Directional and MWD services were performed by Ryan Energy
Company. Joe Hallgren was the well-site geologist providing geo-steering and mudlogging
services were provided by Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.
