6.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 12B is an east lateral Middle Bakken well located in SW
SW SEC 31, T153N, R100W, 647' FSL & 320' FWL, McKenzie County, North Dakota.
The well was drilled to completion at 14:30 hours, 2/19/2015. The projected bottom hole
location is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, 581.88' FSL & 331.53' FEL, McKenzie
County, North Dakota, with aprojected TVD of 10,881.77’.

The targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Middle Bakken “B”
unit, and bounded above and below by lower gamma zones. This window extended from
12’ to 21.5” below the top of the Middle Bakken. The anticipated dip of the formation
was 0.6 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure between 15000’ MD
and 17000’ MD. Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface structure map provided by
Oasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR TVD log was from the
Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T, located on the same pad, 66’ to the north. From this
offset log the Middle Bakken was determined to be approximately 34’ feet thick

The formation had an average dip of 89.58 degrees. The anticipated dip reversal was not
encountered, but we did see a flattening to 89.9 degrees between 16150’ and 16600’. Gas
readings and oil shows were best in the upper 2’-3” of the Middle Bakken “B”.

Currently the well is awaiting completion.
