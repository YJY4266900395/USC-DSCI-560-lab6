Summary

1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T was initially spud for surface drilling on 9th of
November 2014 in the Indian hills McKinley County, North Dakota. The well was spud
by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,330’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-10.8 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,742’.

3) One 12 1/4” Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a vertical depth of
2,185. 2 Smith 8 % bits were used to drill to KOP of 10,330’. One 8 %4” PDC bit was
used to drill the curve to 11,177’ MD. Six 5” PDC bits were used to drill the lateral to
21,050’ TD.

4) The lateral was targeting the Three Forks member ranging from about 20’ below the
base of the Pronghorn down to approximately 1’ above the Claystone.

5) Gas levels between 400 and 1000 units with peaks over 2000 units were maintained
through the target zone of the lateral drilling operations while in the Three Forks.

6) The Three Forks target consisted of one observed gross lithology. The Three Forks was
observed to be a dolostone with lots of disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular
porosity.

7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

8) Drilling operations were concluded on December 16", 2014 at a bottom hole location of
9998.39 ' E & 732.43' S of surface location or approximately 1265.43' FSL & 253.79'
FEL of SE SE Sec. 17, T153N-R100W.
