INTRODUCTION |

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H [SW SE Section 12 TI53N
R101W] is located approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North
Dakota. The well is part of Oasis Petroleum’s Williston Basin drilling program, targeting the
Middle Bakken with two section laterals and utilizing the latest technology in fracture
stimulation completions. The well was permitted for a 10,086” lateral drilling south 1,927’ from
the east line of sections 12, 13 and 24. Directional tools will kick-off from the vertical hole in the
Lodgepole Formation, build a curve and land in the Middle Bakken target zone. The proposed
lateral would be geo-steered within the ideal target rock, focusing on a higher porosity zone
approximately 8 feet from the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. The lateral will be directed
along an azimuth of 180° to a TD approximately 200° from the south line in the SW % of SE 4
Section 24.
