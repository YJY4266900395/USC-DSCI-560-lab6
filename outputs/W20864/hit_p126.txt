RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
BRAY 5301 43-12H
SWSE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzieCounty
Well File # 20864

Dear Brandi :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14007, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200! setback (per ICO 14498) from the north & south boundaries and 1220! setback (per Commission policy)
from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N RIO1W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal
of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO
NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location
construction. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must ensure the pit is not constructed
in fill dirt.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.
