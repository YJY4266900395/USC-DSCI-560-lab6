Continental Resources, Inc. (CRI) respectfully submits the following information concerning the
prevention of a wellbore collision while drilling the Columbus Federal 3-16H, SENE of Sec. 16, T153N,
R101W, Dunn County, North Dakota.

The Mildred 1, NDIC File No. 12306, is a plugged and abandoned, Red River formation, directional
well with a SHL of 1325’ FSL, 660’ FEL of Sec. 4, T153N, R101W. The directional wellbore lies
approximately 660° FEL of Sec. 4, T153N, R101W, terminating at a BHL 769° N. of SHL, 2094° FSL
of Sec. 4, T153N, R101W. Bottom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451’. The deepest
casing string is 8-5/8” set at a depth of 3035° TVD.

The proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken formation.
Surface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469’ FSL and 199’ FEL of Sec. 16, T153N,
R101W. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760°’ FEL in order to avoid the
existing Mildred 1 wellbore by approximately 100°. The lateral will taper back to 660’ FEL, at 10155”
N. of SHL, after adequately clearing the segment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Bakken
pool.

The Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top
of the Bakken Formation to above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of
the area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461’ TVD to 10,771’ TVD. On
the surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximately 38’, from 1874’ FSL
to 1912’ FSL of Sec. 4, T153N, R94W.

The completion of the Columbus Federal 3-16H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.
Stimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 500’ from
either side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Bakken pool. This zone will not be
perforated or completed.

CRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and
accepts all responsibility should such a collision occur.
