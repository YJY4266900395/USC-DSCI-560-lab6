The Second Dakota Sand Top [Dakota Group] was drilled at 5,864’ MD / 5,666’ TVD (-3,484 MSL) 14’ high to the
prognosis depth. Samples are described as follows (Figure 4);

SLTY SANDSTONE: light gray, light brown to brown, firm to friable, very fine grained to fine grained, sub-
rounded to sub-angular, calcareous cemented, quartz in part, possible intergranular porosity; trace
SHALE: medium to dark gray, soft to friable, sub-blocky to blocky, earthy texture, clay in part, no visible
porosity

SLTY SANDSTONE: light brown to brown, firm to friable, fine grained, sub-rounded to sub-angular,
calcareous cemented, quartz in part, possible inter granular porosity

The Second Dakota Sand Base [Dakota Group] was drilled at 6,154’ MD / 5,763’ TVD (-3,573 MSL) 4’ high to the
prognosis depth. Samples are described as follows (Figure 4);

SLTY SANDSTONE: light grey to grey, trace brown firm to friable, fine grained, sub-rounded to sub-angular,
calcareous cemented, quartz in part, possible inter granular porosity

Lateral

Lateral operations began on 30" of June 2013 with bit #4, a 6” Varel PDC. Diesel invert oil based mud was
displaced with saltwater brine for the remainder of the hole. The assembly was pulled from the hole due to mud
motor failure.

Bit #4, a 6” Varel PDC, drilled 348’ in 6 hrs at an average rate of penetration of 58 ft/hr. Proposed total depth was
reached at 10:45 am on 1* July 2013. The Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H well was drilled to a total depth of 6,555’
MD. The bottom hole location using a projected to bit survey is as follows: 1,096.59' N & 297.73' E of surface
location 2,806.59' FNL & 11,422.73' FWL, NW SW Sec. 31, T153N, R100W, Mckenzie County, North Dakota.

Lithology

The Third Dakota Sand Top [Dakota Group] was drilled at 6,264’ MD/ 5,800’ TVD (-3,617 MSL) 5’ high to the
prognosis depth. Samples are described as follows (Figure 5);

SLTY SANDSTONE: light grey to grey, trace brown firm to friable, fine grained, sub-rounded to sub-angular,
calcareous cemented, quartz in part, possible inter granular porosity
