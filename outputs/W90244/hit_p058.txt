Exhibit 3 — Proposed Injection Program

Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Section 31, T153N R100W

McKenzie County, North Dakota

Application for Fluid Injection
PROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM

The Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Indian Hills
area - Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells already on production, in the process of completion, and those
soon to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation.
Injection depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.

The Buck Shot SWD will utilize the existing tanks and pump facilities of the Oasis-operated BWL SWD
5201 11-3. The injection pump will send water to both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot SWD. There will
be a pressure transducer at the outlet of the pump that limits the maximum pressure of the discharge to the
permitted pressure. This pressure transducer will communicate to the VFD that controls the pump to
maximize the efficiency of the pump as well as shut it off at the max allowable pressure. There will be 2
flow meters after the tee in the discharge line, one for the BWL SWD and the other for the Buck Shot
SWD.

The flowline to the Buck Shot wellhead will tap into the existing 6 inch flexsteel pipe that is currently in
operation for the BWL SWD. This flowline is rated for 2250 psi, approximately 700 psi above the
maximum allowable pressure for the Buck Shot SWD. The lease operator will be on location on a daily
basis to monitor both SWD locations and the flowline that feeds both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot
SWD.

The wellhead and horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H well is within the
Y% mile area of review but no corrective action is required as the lateral of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H
is completed within the Bakken Formation which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift
confining layer and several thousand feet of other impermeable shales.

The horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T well is within the % mile area
of review but no corrective action is required as this lateral was drilled within the Bakken Formation
which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift confining layer and several thousand feet of other
impermeable shales. The vertical portion of the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T lies outside of the % mile
AOR for the Buck Shot SWD.

The proposed Buck Shot SWD is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to reduce
costs and ease the burden on regional disposal wells, it will supplement the existing BWL SWD. The
anticipated initial injection rate of the well will be 5,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate
may increase with additional drilling in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling.
