RE: Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31
NWSW Section 31-T153N-R100W
McKenzie County, ND
Baker Field
Well File No. 90244

Dear Mr. Kukuk:

NDIC records indicate that injection into the above saltwater disposal well is through a pipeline from the
offsite tank battery located in the SW/4 of Section 4, Township 152 North, Range 10] West, approximately
1.5 miles northeast to the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 (NDIC file no. 90244) well. The permit for fluid
injection issued September 5, 2012 requires this offsite high pressure injection pipeline be mechanical
integrity tested on an annual basis. The required pipeline pressure test procedure is as follows:

1) Injection pipeline pressure test must be witnessed by an NDIC Field Inspector. Contact the
appropriate NDIC Field Inspector to schedule the test.

2) The entire duration of the pressure test must be recorded on a chart recorder.

3) Pressure line to 100 psi. above the permitted maximum injection pressure and test for 30
minutes. Be sure to note the starting and ending pressures.

4) Depending on the results as determined by the NDIC:

a. It may be necessary to shut in the pressurized line for 24 hours to stabilize temperature
of test fluid and allow any air or gases to accumulate in order to be purged.

b. Following the 24 hour shut-in period, re-pressurize line and document the amount of
fluid needed to return pressure to 100 psi. above the permitted maximum injection
pressure.

c. Pressure Test line for 30 minutes.

5) Submit to the NDIC a Form 4 Sundry Notice detailing the test results (e.g. date of test, starting
and ending pressures, amount of fluid, etc.), Be sure to include as an attachment to the Sundry
Notice the pressure recorded data (i.e. a copy of the chart) of the entire procedure.

Please proceed diligently to perform this test by May 2, 2016. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to
contact me.

Sincerely,

ee ee
