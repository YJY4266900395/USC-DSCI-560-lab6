Salt Water Disposal Well
McKenzie County, North Dakota
31-153N-100W

Cretaceous Dakota within the Inyan Kara is 450’ thick in this area. The section
consists of a sequence of alternating sand, silt and shale. Individual sand layers
can be up to 50’ thick and display a porosity of 20-25%. In the Lindvig 3-14 this
section is quite laminated and shows a higher sand percentage toward the base of
the section. Sands are generally poorly sorted and vary from fine to coarse
grained.

The Skull Creek/Newcastle is predominantly medium gray shale and is
interbedded with thin layers of siltstone and sandy siltstone. It is about 250’ in
the Lindvig 3-14 well.

The Swift Shale consists of gray shales in the upper portion, These shales
become interbedded with limestones and sandy limestones lower in the
section. It is 460’ in the Lindvig 3-14.
