5.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Wade Federal 5300 41-30 6B is a South lateral Middle Bakken well located in SEC 30,
T153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was 20°
under the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. This pay zone was picked for its production
potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the
defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.

The primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter
layering between dolomitic siltstone and limy sandstones. Gamma patterns were
compared with the offset log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in
order to land in the targeted zone. Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating
dip from relevant gamma markers, as well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to
determine our position within the formation.

The formation had an average dip of 89.5°. (see pg. 5, fig 4.1 for a detailed formation dip
profile).

Currently the well is awaiting completion.
