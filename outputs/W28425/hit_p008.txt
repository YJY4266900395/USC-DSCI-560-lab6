Table 3.1 Wade Federal 5300 41-30 6B Formation Tops

3.2 Lithology
Sample analysis began at 8,000’ MD in the Otter Formation.

3.3 Formation Dip
The formation had an average dip of 89.5°.

3.4 Shows
The vertical-build section was drilled with invert mud and the lateral was drilled with
brine/production water. The oil-based mud contributed a background gas of 200-300
units, and saturated cuttings with oil, making all cuttings in the vertical show the same
cut and fluorescence. Gas shows were around 3500+ units during the drilling of the
lateral.

3.5 Oil Shows
Invert mud was used in the vertical, masking any oil shows. In the lateral part of the well
the oil shows were consistently a bright blue green florescence with a bright diffuse blue
to blue green cut and a medium brown residue ring.

4.0 WELLBORE
The surface location is 910' FSL & 280' FWL SEC 30, T153N, R100W, McKenzie
County, North Dakota. Ground elevation is 2,045’ and KB elevation was 2,076’,
referenced to the Kelly bushing of Patterson 488. The curve was landed in the Middle
Bakken at 11,032’ MD; 10,725’ TVD. The lateral was drilled to TD at 20,450’ MD,
10,812’ TVD, 994’ FSL & 773’ FEL; SEC 30. Figure 4.1 shows a cross-section of the
lateral.
