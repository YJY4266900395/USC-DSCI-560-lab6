1.0 INTRODUCTION

Wade Federal 5200 41-30 6B is a East lateral Middle Bakken well located in SEC 30,
T153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was
approximately 20’ under the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. This pay zone was
picked for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to
steer the well within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.
Directional and MWD services were performed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and RPM.
Heather A. Coutts, Jake Robertson and Dylan E. Fowler were the primary well site
geologists; providing geo-steering and mud logging from Columbine Logging, Inc.
