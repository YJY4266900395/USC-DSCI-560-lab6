A plat showing the location of the central facility. 3. Affidavit of title indicating common ownership. Oasis will
allocate production measured at the central production facility to the various wells on the basis of isolated
production tests utilizing oil, gas, and water meters on a test separator at the central production facility. Oasis will
measure the production from each well separately each month for a minimum of three days. Oasis believes that
such allocation will result in an accurate determination of production from each well. Tank vapor gas is being
recovered and burned by a 98% DRE enclosed combuster.
