6.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 13T is an east lateral Three Forks well located in SW SW
SEC 31, T153N, R100W, 713' FSL & 320' FWL, McKenzie County, North Dakota. The
well was drilled to completion at 17:30 hours, 3/02/2015. The projected bottom hole
location is: SE SE SEC 32, T153N, R100W, McKenzie County, North Dakota, with a
projected TVD of 10,932.98’.

The targeted pay zone for the wellbore was a window within the Three Forks first bench.
This window extended from 13’ to 24’ below the top of the Three Forks. The anticipated
dip of the formation was 0.5 degrees down overall, with a possibly dip reversal structure
between 16000’ MD and 17500’ MD. Anticipated dip was based on a subsurface
structure map provided by Oasis Petroleum, and nearby laterals. Our primary offset GR
TVD log was from the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31 31T, located on the same pad, 33’ to
the south. From this offset log the Three Forks was determined to be approximately 26’
feet thick

The formation had an average dip of 89.6 degrees. The anticipated dip reversal was
encountered. We did see a flattening to 90.1 degrees between 16000’ and 17500’. Gas
readings and oil shows were best in the lower 5’-6’ of the Three Forks “A”.

Currently the well is awaiting completion.
