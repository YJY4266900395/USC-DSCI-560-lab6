Wade Federal 5200 41-30 7T is a East lateral Three Forks 1° Bench well located in SEC 30,
TI153N, R1O0W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was approximately
20’ under the base of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked
for its production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well
within the defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state. MWD services were
performed by Schlumberger/Pathfinder and Directional services were provided by RPM. Heather
A. Coutts, Jake Robertson and Dylan E. Fowler were the primary well site geologists; providing
