5.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Wade Federal 5300 41-30 7T is a East lateral Three Forks 1‘ Bench well located in SEC 30,
TI153N, R100W in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary pay zone was 20’ under the
bottom of the Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation. This pay zone was picked for its
production potential and quality of reservoir rock. The objective was to steer the well within the
defined pay zone and within the legal requirements of the state.

The primary objective was to stay near the middle gamma markers which marks the inter
layering between limy sandstones and siltstones. Gamma patterns were compared with the offset
log and a TVD log was created while landing the curve to in order to land in the targeted zone.
Steering in the lateral was accomplished by calculating dip from relevant gamma markers, as
well as by using lithology, total gas and ROP to determine our position within the formation.

The formation had an average dip of 89.35°. Refer to Figure 4.1 on page 6 for a detailed
formation dip profile.

Currently the well is awaiting completion.
