INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North American, LLC. Innoko 5301 43-12T [SW SE Section 12, T153N,

development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field (Figure 1). The well was planned
to drill an approximately 9,288’ long lateral, along a proposed azimuth of 181.25°. The well-
bore will be enhanced for production by multi-stage fracture stimulation.
