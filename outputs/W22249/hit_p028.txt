INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. Magnum 2-36-25H [SE SE Sec. 36, T153N,
R101W] is located ~15 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota
and is part of an ongoing drilling program exploiting the Bakken pool in Baker Field. The well is
the second of three laterals planned for the spacing unit and will consist of a 9,713” lateral drilled
from south to north, exploiting the eastern third of sections 36 and 25. Directional tools will
build a curve and “land” in the Middle Bakken target within the legal setbacks of the spacing
unit, where 7” production casing will be set to isolate up hole formations. The lateral will be geo-
steered in the ideal target rock, with the goals of drilling efficiently and minimizing doglegs, to a
proposed TD in the NE % of NE % of Section 25.
