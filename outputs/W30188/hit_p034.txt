Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in the Indian Hill prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was
drilled from surface casing to total depth in 19 days. A total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:30
hours CST on 22 January 2019. The well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired
target interval for 84% within target, opening 9,744’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly light to medium gray, light brown and
occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is composed of fine to very fine grained, sub-
rounded and occasionally sub-angular, moderately sorted quartz grains. Primary cement is calcite and rare
quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite are present. Poor to fair intergranular porosity contains trace
to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows
were encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:
e Maximum exposure to the target
¢ Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
e No side-tracks, shale strikes, or collision with existing wellbores

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.
