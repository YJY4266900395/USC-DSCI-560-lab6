Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 1 Section 31, T153N, R1O0W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town
of Williston, in the Indian Hills prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 3B is the second of three wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 pad. Due to tight
hole conditions the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4B was plugged and abandoned. This pad is set up as a 1,280-
acre laydown spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to
drill east from the surface location in Section 31 into Section 32. The well consists of a single Middle
Bakken Member lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture
trends enhancing reservoir quality.

Engineering Operations Overview

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B was spud on January 3, 2019. The surface hole was drilled with one
17.5” assembly to a depth of 3,605’. The complete BHA accomplishments can be found in an appendix to
this report. The 13 3/8” surface casing was set to a depth of 3,600’. Due to the presence of several salt water
disposal wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through
the Inyan Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,090’. The
9 5/8” casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,075’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed
with two 8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,427’ before being replace due
to low ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,190’ (KOP). The curve assembly consisted
of two 8.75” assemblies. The first assembly, a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#5), attached to a 2.38° NOV mud
motor and Scientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,039’ before a trip was required due to low
build rates. The second curve BHA consisted of a Security F30T tri-cone bit, a 2.50° NOV mud motor and
Scientific drilling MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,132’ MD and 10,790’ TVD,
approximately 32’ below the Upper Bakken Shale on 15 January 2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,116’ MD at landing. The lateral was completed using two 6” assemblies.
The first lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 16,675” before a trip was required due to an MWD failure.
The second lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 17,009’ before another MWD failure occurred. Due to the
short footage between the first and second lateral trips the bit and motor were not replaced after the second
trip. The lateral reached a total depth of 20,860’ on January 22, 2019.
