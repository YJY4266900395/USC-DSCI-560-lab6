INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum, North America, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B [Lot 1. Section 18, T153N,
R100W] is located approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota.
The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the Williston Basin
consisting of one 9,773’ lateral drilled toward the East. Geologically, the Williston Basin is an
intracratonic, structural, and sedimentary basin located at the western edge of the Canadian Shield.
Within the basin, the Middle Bakken Formation (Late Devonian to early Mississippian) consists
of four members: the basal pronghorn member (formerly recognized as the Sanish Siltstone) which
underlies lower and upper organic-rich shale members deposited above and below the clastic and
coastal-carbonate middle member which consists of calcareous and dolomitic silty sandstone and
siltstone shore facies.

ENGINEERING

The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B surface, vertical and curve were drilled earlier in 2015 by a
different drilling rig. Extreme 21 returned to the location in May 2015 to drill the laterals of the
Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B, 3T, 2B. The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B was re-entered on May
15, 2015. To start the lateral, a 6” Baker Hughes PDC bit, Ryan Directional Services MWD tool,
and a 1.5° adjustable Baker Hughes mud motor were used. The complete BHA accomplishment
are tabulated in an appendix (BHA Record) to this report. The well reached total depth (TD) at
20,895' MD at 07:15 hrs CDT on May 20, 2015, generating an exposure of 9,773’ linear feet of 6”
hole through the Middle Bakken target interval. The bottom hole location (BHL) lies 1,137.92'
south & 9,944.75! east of surface location or approximately 2,187.92' FNL & 325.56' FEL Lot 1.
