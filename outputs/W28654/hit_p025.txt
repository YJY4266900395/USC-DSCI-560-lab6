Summary

1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X was initially spud for surface drilling on 17th of
September 2014 in the Indian Hills field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well
was spud by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of
10,300’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (10.3-11.6 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.8-9.9 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,760’.

3) One 8 %” Haliburton PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of
10,300’. One 8 %4” PDC bit was used to drill the curve to 11,185’ MD. One 6” PDC bit
was used to drill the lateral to 20,760’ TD.

4) The lateral was targeting the Three Forks member ranging from about 8’ below the base
of the Pronghorn down to approximately 1’ above the Claystone.

5) Gas levels between 40 and 100 units and peaks as high as 160 units were maintained
through the lateral drilling operations while in the Three Forks.

6) The Three Forks target consisted of one observed gross lithology. The Three Forks was
observed to be a dolostone with lots of disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular
porosity.

7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

8) Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on Febuary 7", 2015 at a bottom hole
location of 10,022.35' E & 599.11'S of surface location or approximately 198.11' FNL &
280.4' FEL of NE NE Sec. 20, T153N, RIOOW.
