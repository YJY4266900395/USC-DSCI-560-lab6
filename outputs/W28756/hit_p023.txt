INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 6B is a horizontal Middle
Bakken well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from the
surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-hole
location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders and
200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Middle Bakken lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,221’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the
Middle Bakken. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land
in the Middle Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum
is targeting a silty sandstone facies of the Middle Bakken with intent to intersect porosity and
fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval
