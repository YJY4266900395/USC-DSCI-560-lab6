DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC requests a variance to rule 43-02-03-31 requiring electrical, radioactive or other
similar logs to be run to determine formation tops and zones of porosity. The surface location of this well will be
very near our Kline Federal 5300 11-18H (API #33-053-03426 NDIC # 20275) in Lot 1, Section 18, T153N, R100W and
the logs run on this well should be sufficient to determine formation tops in the vertical section of the well bore. As
outlined in our application for permit to drill, Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC will run gamma ray logs from KOP
to the total depth and cement bond log from the production casing total depth to surface. Two digital copies of all
mud logs (one tif and one las) will be submitted to the NDIC.
