INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R well [SE SE Section 24,
TI153N, R101W] is located approximately 31 miles south of Williston, North Dakota. The
horizontal well was spud on June 22, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis Petroleum’s
development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Chalmers was planned to
drill an approximately 9,863” lateral along a proposed azimuth of 91.34°. The well bore will be
enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation.

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Structure’
section appended to this report. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR and the Chalmers 5301 44-24
2TR were the primary offsets used because they are located on the same pad.
