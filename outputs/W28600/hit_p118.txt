API Rating & Safety Factor
a. *Assume full casing evacuation with 10 ppg fluid on backside. **Assume full casing
evacuation with 1.2 psi/ft equivalent fluid gradient across salt intervals.
b. Burst pressure based on 9000 psig max press for stimulation plus 10.2 ppg fluid in
casing and 9 ppg fluid on backside-to 10,630' TVD.
c. Based on string weight in 10 ppg fluid, (295k Ibs buoyed weight) plus 100k Ibs overpull.

Cement volumes are estimates based on 7" casing set in an 8-3/4" hole with 30% excess.
