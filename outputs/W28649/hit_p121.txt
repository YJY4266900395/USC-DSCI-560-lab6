API Rating & Safety Factor

a) Collapse pressure based on full casing evacuation with 9 ppg fluid on backside (2126' setting
depth).
b) Burst pressure based on 9 ppg fluid with no fluid on backside (2126' setting depth).

¢) Tension based on string weight in 9 ppg fluid at 2126' TVD plus 100k# overpull. (Buoyed weight
equals 100k Ibs.)

Cement volumes are based on 13-3/8" casing set in 17-1/2" hole with 50% excess to circulate cement back to surface.
