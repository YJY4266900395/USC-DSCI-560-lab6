d) Collapse pressure based on 11.5ppq fluid on backside and 9ppq fluid inside of casing.

e) Burst pressure caiculated from a gas kick coming from the production zone (Bakken Pool) at
9,000psi and a subsequent breakdown at the 9-5/8" shoe, based on a 13.5#/ft fracture gradient.
Backup of 9 ppg fluid.

#) Tension based on string weight in 10 ppg fiuid, (217k Ibs buoyed weight) plus 100k tbs overpull.

Cement volumes are estimates based on 9-5/8" casing set in an 12-1/4" hole with 10% excess in OH and 0% excess
inside surface casing. TOC at surface.
