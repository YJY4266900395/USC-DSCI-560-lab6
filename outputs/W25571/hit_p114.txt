Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21551, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200! setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into
consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on
the above captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable
electric lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil
tank.” Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.
In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided
affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the
cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO NO
AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited, All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.
