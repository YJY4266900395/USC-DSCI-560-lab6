CLAYSTONE

Figure 9. Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C, with target points.

Steering decisions were made by using the higher gamma, of the underlying claystone, the low
gamma located in the middle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to
medium gamma located at the top of the drilling zone.

The TD of 21,090’ MD was achieved at 1720 hours CDT on August 12, 2013. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 76% of the
lateral, opening 10,141’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated
and reamed for completion.
