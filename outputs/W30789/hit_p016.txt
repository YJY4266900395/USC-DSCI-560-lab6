North Dakota.

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a horizontal First Bench
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 200’ setbacks along the north and south borders
and 500’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately
10,293’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the First Bench Three
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum is
targeting a dolomite shale facies of the Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect porosity
and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.
