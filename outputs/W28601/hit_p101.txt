Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be located
approximately down the east-west axis of the spacing unit (within 250” of the section line per Commission policy)
and no closer than the 20! setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting
of Sections 19, 20, 29, & 30 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. DUE TO
STREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE
ENTIRE LOCATION. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn
at 701-770-3554 prior to setting conductor.

drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited, All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.
