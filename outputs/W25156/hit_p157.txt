RE: | HORIZONTAL WELL
COLUMBUS FEDERAL 1-16H
NESE Section 16-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 25156

Dear Terry:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21551, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on
the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200" setback from the north & south
boundaries and 1220" setback (per Commission policy) from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of
Sections 4 & 9-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: No Drilling Pit will be allowed. The Rat and Mouse hole must be cemented. In cases where a
spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-
well pad agrees to accept burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite
spacing/drilling unit. Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.
CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. must run open hole logs to include a porosity and resistivity log from KOP to the base
of the surface casing. Liner required under the location. Spill contingency plan must be in place prior to spud.
CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location
construction.

Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director
prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. ‘The proposed directional
plan is at a legal location, ‘The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing point are: 2869” N & 902’ W. Also, based on the
azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 12908’ N and a minimum legal coordinate from the
well head of 902’ W.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(8), and
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner secks revocation of the drilling permit,
the applicant should retain the permit.
