Dear Mr. Harshbarger;

This letter will hereby set forth Continental Resources’ intention to drill and complete the Atlanta #1
SWD as a Salt Water Disposal Well in the Dakota formation at an approximate depth of 5450’ —
5900’. The Atlanta #1 SWD is proposed at the location of 260° FNL & 432’ FWL of Sec 6-T153N-
RI101W in Williams County, North Dakota.

No response is needed if you have no objection to Continental Resources installing a Salt Water
Disposal Well at this location. However, if you do object, please advise Continental Resources and/or
the North Dakota Industrial Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter.

According to our investigation of ownership of surface landowners within the area of review, it
appears that Rory Harshbarger owns the following tracts of land: Lot 2R Block 5 of the
Rearrangement of Block 5 Berger First Subdivision.

‘These tracts of land are considered to be within the area of review, which is within a “ mile radius of
the proposed Atlanta #1 SWD well,

Sincerely,

Don Kennedy
Sr. Production Engineer
