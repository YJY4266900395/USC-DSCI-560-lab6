API Rating & Safety Factor

a) Based on full casing evacuation with 9 ppg fluid on backside (2110' setting depth).
b) Burst pressure based on 9 ppg fluid with no fluid on backside (2110' setting depth).
c) Based on string weight in 9 ppg fluid at 2110' TVD plus 100k# overpull. (Buoyed weight equals 99k Ibs.)

Cement volumes are based on 13-3/8" casing set in 17-1/2" hole with 40% excess to circulate cement back to surface.
