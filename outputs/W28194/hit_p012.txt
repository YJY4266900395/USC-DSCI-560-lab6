Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 2 Section 31, T153N, R101W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town
of Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is the first
of two wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown
spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100° E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from
the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member
lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends enhancing
reservoir quality.
Engineering Operations Overview

The 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,325’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival.
Nabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 16, 2019. Due to the presence of several salt water disposal
wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan
Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,097’. The 9 5/8”
casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,077’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed with two
8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,485’ before being replace due to low
ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,270’ (KOP). While drilling in the Mission
Canyon, at a depth of 9,821” the driller noticed that the mud volume was increasing. A flow test indicated
that the well was taking on water. A cement bond log will be run at a later date, but as of this report, it is
assumed that the cement job on the 9 5/8” casing string was poor and lead to water from the Inyan Kara
flowing into the wellbore. To resolve the water flow for the time being, the drilling choke was engaged to
increase pressure on the back side of the drill pipe and hold back the water flow. From 9,821°-10,270° ~350
psi casing back pressure was maintained to reduce the water influx.
