Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in the Indian Hill prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was
drilled from surface casing to total depth in 17 days. Due to the wellbore proximity to the Upper Bakken
Shale a sidetrack was utilized at a depth of 15,620’. A total depth of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 05:20
hours on May 3, 2019. The well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target
interval for 95% within target, opening 9,730’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown,
light brown gray, light to medium gray silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine grained. The
middle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth,
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite are
present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain was
visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:

e Maximum exposure to the target
e Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
¢ No shale strikes

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.
