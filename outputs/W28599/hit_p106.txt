API Rating & Safety Factor
a) Burst pressure calculated from a gas kick coming from the production zone (Bakken Pool)
at 9,000psi and a subsequent breakdown at the 9-5/8” shoe, based on a 13.5#/ft fracture
gradient. Backup of 9 ppg fluid.
b) Collapse pressure based on 11.5ppg fluid on backside and 9ppg fluid inside of casing.
c) Yield based on string weight in 10 ppg fluid, (217k lbs buoyed weight) plus 100k Ibs

Cement volumes are estimates based on 9-5/8" casing set in an 12-1/4" hole with 10% excess in OH and 0% excess

overpull.
