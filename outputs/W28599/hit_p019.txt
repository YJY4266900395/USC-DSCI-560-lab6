INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR well [SE SE Section 24,

horizontal well was spud on June 11, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis Petroleum’s
development of the Bakken Formation within Baker Field. The Chalmers 3BR was planned to
drill an approximately 9,953’ lateral along a proposed azimuth of 91.52°. The well bore will be
enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation.
