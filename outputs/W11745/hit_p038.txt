Well File# 45

The application of Nance Petroleum Corp. for a Stripper Wel! Property determination was
received July 28, 2003. The application requests that the Industrial Commission determine the following
well in McKenzie County. North Dakota, to be a Stripper Well Property:

Dear Ms. Torgerson:

: TIS3N, RIOIW
Section 2 Well File =11745

Information contained in the application indicates that the land descnbed above is a property
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01(3) North Dakota Century Code (NDCC). However, during the twelve
consecutive months qualifying period March 2001 thru February 2002. The average daily production
from the well, exceeds the maximum allowable production for stripper well status.

It is therefore determined that the lands described above do not qualify as a Stripper Well Property
pursuant io Section 57-51.1-01 NDCC. The application is hereby denied.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review’ the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by addi:ional or newly

discovered information. If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to contact this office.

Sincerely,
