RE: Workover Project Determination
Basic Game & Fish #34-3
SW SW Sec, 2-T153N-R101W
Well File #11745

Dear Mr. Evertz:

On June 30, 1997, Panterra Petroleum filed a notice of intent to begin a
workover project on the above listed well with the North Dakota Industrial
Commission. The workover project was completed on September 16, 1997 and
meets the requirements set forth in North Dakota Century Code Section
57-51.1-03.

The workover project was performed from September 9, 1997 to
September 16, 1997. The total cost of the project was $29,075. The
average daily production prior to commencement of the workover project from
December 1996 through May 1997 was 23.5 barrels of oil per day. The
average daily production during the first sixty days after completion of the
workover project was 38.7 barrels of oil per day.

Therefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a
workover project for tax exemption purposes. The Commission shall have
continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the matter.
The determination may be amended or rescinded by the Commission for good

cause.
Sincerely,
Kent Fetzer
Petroleum Engineer
