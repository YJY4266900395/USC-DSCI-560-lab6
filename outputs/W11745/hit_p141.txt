Dear Mr. Evertz:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 9261, approval to deviate the well bore of the above

The approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by
cement, be no closer than 500 feet from the spacing unit boundary consisting of the $2 of Section

compliance with setbacks.

A directional survey of the well showing the location of the well bore shall be filed with the
Industrial Commission within 30 days after completion of the well. Such survey must be certified by
a representative of the survey contractor and mailed directly to us by the contractor, Survey points
shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Sincerely,
