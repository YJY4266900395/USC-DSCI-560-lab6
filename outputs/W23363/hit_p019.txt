WELL SYNOPSIS

The Atlanta Federal 10-6H was spud on September 6", 2013 with a surface location of

495’ FNL and 1305’ FWL, NENW Section 6 - Township 153 North and Range 101 West in Williams
County, North Dakota. This well was operated by Continental Resources Incorporated with the
objective target of the late Devonian Three Forks Formation.

The plan showed a build section with a kickoff point of 10011’ MD in the Mississippian Lodgepole
with a 10°/100’ build rate to the landing point of 10911’ MD; 10584’ TVD in the clean gamma
zone within the Three Forks Formation. This zone started approximately 11’ below the Three
Forks. The landing target was approximately 15’ into the Three Forks Formation. The plan was to
drill lateral for an estimated 9655’ to the hardline in the NENE corner of section 8 - Township 153
North and Range 101 West following the estimated dip of 89.9°. The projected well path is to the
Southeast with a proposed azimuth of 118.43°.

The offsets provided were the Atlanta wells already drilled on the Atlanta Eco pad. These include
the Atlanta 1-6H through 4-6H, 11-6H through 14-6H, and Atlanta Federal 5-6H through 9-6H
drilled by Continental Resources.

Gas logged in the vertical and lateral sections were monitored using Mud Logging Systems —
Mlogger & Mcontrol. (Primary Logger: ML-137 — Backup Logger ML-077)

M-Logger CC & TC filaments calibrated with 1% and 100% test gas — Chromatograph calibrated
with 1% test gas (gas—units).

The well was kicked off at 10080’ MD on September 11", 2013 at 00:25 hrs. The up hole markers
logged were the Charles Salt (8310’ TVD), Base of the Last Salt (9019’ TVD), Mission Canyon
(9241’ TVD), and the Lodgepole (9784’ TVD). The down hole markers below kick off point
consisted of the False Bakken (10483’ TVD), Upper Bakken Shale (10493’ TVD), Middle Bakken
Member (10508’ TVD), Lower Bakken Shale (10542’ TVD), Three Forks Dolomite (10574’ TVD).
The down hole markers fluctuated between 1-3’ high versus the other Atlanta Eco Pad Three
Forks Wells and fluctuated 1-3’ in thickness. The Bakken Shale and Middle Bakken Dolomite
came in 1-2’ higher than the previous Atlanta Wells giving us an estimated landing @ 10589’
TVD. The Lower Bakken Shale had a thickness of 11’ of actual black-brown shale, but consisted of
a sticky intermediate layer (Pronghorn) below the shale that was 23’ thick — our landing was
targeted 15’ below the base of this intermediate layer in the clean Dolomite zone. The landing
was completed September 12", 2013 at 10:40 hrs @ 10938’ MD, with a Casing point: 10918’ MD;
10589.28’ TVD and casing location of NENW Sec 6: 786’ FNL & 1818’ FWL (See Atlanta Federal
10-6H Build and TVD log for more information regarding samples & formation thicknesses)

Gas observed in the build section showed gas averaging 52 units through the Lodgepole
formation with trace amounts of background sample shows and oil shows. Both Upper and
Lower Bakken Shale resulted in 129-2205 units. The Middle Bakken Member ranged from 230-
1259 units, averaging 290 units. The Three Forks ranged from 230-480 units, averaging 263 units.
Connection gasses ranged from 521 units to 1267 units through the entire build section. (See
Atlanta Federal 10-6H Build Log, for more detailed gas data)
