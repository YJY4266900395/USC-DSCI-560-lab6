Summary

1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was initially spud for surface drilling on September
9th 2014 in the Indian Hill field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud
by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,240’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-9.9 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,475’.

3) Two 8 %” Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of 10,240’.
Two 8 %” PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,175’ MD. Four 6” PDC bits were
used to drill the lateral to 20,475’ TD.

4) The lateral was targeting the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation member
ranging from about 9’ and 19’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale

5) Gas levels between 3000 and 4000 units were maintained with peaks over 8000 units
through the lateral drilling operations while in the Middle Member.

6) The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation target consisted of one observed gross
lithology. The Middle Member was observed to be a silty sandstone with lots of
disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular porosity with visible oil stain.

7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

8) Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on July 8", 2014 at a bottom hole location of
254.45' south & 9968.39' east of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL &
283.76' FEL of SE SE Sec. 22, T153N-R100W.

9) Oasis Petroleum’s Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential.
