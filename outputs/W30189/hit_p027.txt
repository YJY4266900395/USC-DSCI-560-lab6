Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was drilled from surface casing to
total depth in 20 days. A total depth of 20,870’ MD was achieved at 21:30 hours on 13 January 2019. The
well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target interval for 96.6% within
target, opening 9,779’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light to
medium gray, light brown, and occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine
grained. The middle member typically contained sub round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples
are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular
pyrite are present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil
stain was visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows
were encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:

e Maximum exposure to the target
e Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
e No side-tracks, shale strikes, or collision with existing wellbores

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.
