Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 1 Section 31, T153N, R101W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town
of Williston, in the Indian Hills prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 2B is the third of four wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 pad. Due to tight
hole conditions the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4B was plugged and abandoned. This pad is set up as a 1,280
acre laydown spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to
drill east from the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken
Member lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends
enhancing reservoir quality.
