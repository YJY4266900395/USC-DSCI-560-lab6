Dear Kaitlin :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal
of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. A perimeter dike is required along the north & east sides of the location. OASIS must
contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing
point is: 150W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 9952S & 150W.

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.
