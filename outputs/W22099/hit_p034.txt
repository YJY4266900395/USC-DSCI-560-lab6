INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is
located approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The
Yukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s
Camp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,335’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three
Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southwest quarter of section 12,
then drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional
drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.
