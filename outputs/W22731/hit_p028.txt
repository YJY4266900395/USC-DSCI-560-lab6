INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum 3-36-25H [SE SE Sec. 36, T153N, R101W] is located
~15 miles southwest of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
the third of three wells drilled in Section 36. Magnum 3-36-25H was planned with one 10,386”
long northbound leg with intent to intersect regional fracture trends that might enhance reservoir
quality within the Middle Bakken Member.

Directional tools were utilized to build a curve and land within the 200’ legal setbacks of Section
36. Vertical deviation drilling was used to help ensure the wellbore crossed the eastern hard-line.
A single horizontal lateral in the Middle Bakken was proposed to be drilled into the NE % of NE
‘4 of Section 25.
