INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T [SW NW Section 30,
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 5 miles south of Williston, North Dakota. The horizontal
well was spud on September 30, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis Petroleum’s
development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T
was planned to drill an approximately 9,350’ lateral along a proposed azimuth of 89.37°. The well
bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation.

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found ‘Structure’ section
appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to successfully land
within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these wells
were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to successfully land the
curve.
