SWNW Section 30-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28976

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
gtanted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from
the north & south boundaries and 200" setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting
of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC
Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit
NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The
proposed ditectional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate
from the well head is: 10043’E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting petiod may be waived by the Director.
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.
