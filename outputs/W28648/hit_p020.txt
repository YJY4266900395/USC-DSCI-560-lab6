INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B [Lot 2 Section 19,
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 9B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,369' (uncased) lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical
hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees
per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in
the northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Middle
Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.
