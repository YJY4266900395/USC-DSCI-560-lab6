API Rating & Safety Factor

a) Collapse pressure based on full casing evacuation with 9 ppg fluid on backside (2126' setting
depth).
b) Burst pressure based on 9 ppg fluid with no fluid on backside (2126' setting depth).

¢) Tension based on string weight in 9 ppg fluid at 2126' TVD plus 100k# overpull. (Buoyed weight
equals 100k Ibs.)

Cement volumes are based on 13-3/8" casing set in 17-1/2" hole with 50% excess to circulate cement back to surface.
Mix and pump the following slurry.

Pre-flush (Spacer): 20 bbls fresh water

Lead Slurry: 629 sks (325 bbls) 2.9 yield conventional system with 94 Ib/sk cement, .25 Ib/sk D130 Lost
Circulation Control Agent, 2% CaCL2, 4% D079 Extender, and 2% D053 Expanding Agent.

Tail Slurry: 374 sks (77 bbls) 1.16 yield conventional system with 94 Ib/sk cement, .25 Ib/sk Lost Circulation
Control Agent, and .25% CaCL2.
