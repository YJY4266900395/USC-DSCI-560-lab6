AP! Rating & Safety Factor

d) Collapse pressure based on 11.5ppg fluid on backside and 9ppg fluid inside of casing.

e) Burst pressure calculated from a gas kick coming from the production zone (Bakken Pool) at
9,000psi and a subsequent breakdown at the 9-5/8" shoe, based on a 13.5#/ft fracture gradient.
Backup of 9 ppg fluid.

1) Tension based on string weight in 10 ppg fluid, (217k Ibs buoyed weight) plus 100k ibs overpull

Cement volumes are estimates based on 9-5/8" casing set in an 12-1/4" hole with 10% excess in OH and 0% excess
inside surface casing. TOC at surface.

Pre-flush (Spacer): 20 bbis Chern wash

Lead Slurry: 540 sks (280 bbls) Conventional system with 75 Ib/sk cement, 0.5Ib/sk lost circulation, 10%
expanding agent, 2% extender, 2% CaCl2, 0.2% anti foam, and 0.4% fluid loss

Tail Slurry: 373 sks (77 bbls) Conventional system with 94 Ib/sk cement, 0.3% anti-settling agent, 0.3%
fluid loss agent, 0.3 Ib/sk lost circulation control agent, 0.2% anti foam, and 0.1% retarder
