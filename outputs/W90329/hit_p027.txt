on the Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H. The section consists of a sequence
of alternating sand, silt and shale, Several! potential injection zones occur
between 5,501’ and 5,943° based on the Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H.
These zones vary in thickness between 10’ to 80’.

Shales of the Skull Creek and Newcastle units confine the upper boundary of the
Inyan Kara Formation. Individual shale units over 60° thick are inter-bedded
with thinner siltstones.
