McKenzie County, North Dakota

Application for Fluid Injection
PROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM

The Carson SWD 5301 12-24 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Baker Field-
Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells- already on production, in the process of eompletion, and those soon
to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation. Injection
depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.

The source wells for the produced water are listed on Exhibit 6 but will also include additional Bakken
and Three Forks wells yet to be drilled and completed. Water from these wells will be shipped via
pipeline to the Carson SWD 5301 12-24 disposal site; trucking will only be done for emergency and/or
unplanned circumstances. The amount of water injected into the Dakota is pressure dependent, but not to
exceed 4,558 psig at surface.
so

The proposed Carson SWD 5301 12-24 is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to
reduce costs and case the burden on regional disposal wells. The anticipated initial injection rate of the
well will be 10,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate may increase with additional drilling
in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling. malvern daily M|ection rade,
