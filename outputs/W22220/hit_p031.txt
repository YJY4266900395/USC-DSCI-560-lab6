e@ Summary

The Jefferies 5301 43-12B was spud 31 January 2012 in the Baker Field in McKenzie
County, North Dakota.

Bit #1 was used to drill the vertical section from the conductor pipe at 105’ to 2,190’.
Surface casing was set at 2,170’ and isolated with 9 %” 36# J-55 casing pipe. Bit #2
was used to drill the remainder of the vertical hole to a total depth of 10,270’.

Bit #3 was used to drill the first 449° of the curve and was replaced with a tricone bit due
to inadequate build rates. Bit #4 drilled the final 391’ of the curve which allowed for the
build rates needed to reach the landing target.

Intermediate casing was set to 11,093’ MD / ~ 10,746’ TVD and isolated with 7” casing
pipe. Bit #5 was used to drill out of intermediate casing and drilled the entire 10,140"
lateral.

The target zone consisted of a 9’ thick vertical section of the Middle Member of the
Bakken Formation situated 10’ to 19’ feet below the Upper Shale of the Bakken
Formation. The target zone was identified at the top and bottom by low gamma
readings.

Background gas levels ranged from ~2,700 to ~3,400 units while drilling the lateral.
Gas was diverted through the gas buster producing an average flare of 2’ to 6’
throughout the lateral.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation observed in cutting samples consisted of
two primary facies observed while drilling in the target zone: 1) light gray silty sandstone
with visible oil staining and 2) light gray silty sandstone with trace amounts of patchy oil
stain.

Drilling operations were ceased on 21 February 2012 at 11:33 hours at an approximate
bottom hole location of 829.15’ E & 10,518.38’ S of surface location or approximately
268.38’ FSL & 2,027.93’ FEL in SWSE Section 24 T153N R101W.
