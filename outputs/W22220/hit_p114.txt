SWSE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22220

Dear Kaitlin:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 13 & 24-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the
disposal of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO
NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location
construction.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing
point is: 450’ S & 1910’ E. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates
from the well head is: 1910’ E & 10586’ S.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification
Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
