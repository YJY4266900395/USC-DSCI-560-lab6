Well Evaluation
Synopsis

The Jefferies 5301 43-12B [SWSE Section 12, T153N, R101W] is a horizontal well located in
the Baker Field in McKenzie County, North Dakota approximately 6 miles south of Williston.
The prognosis proposed a single lateral leg trending due south to be drilled through sections
13 and 24 from the SWSE corner of Section 12 to the SE SW corner of Section 24. The lateral
portion of the Jefferies 5301 43-12B targeted the porous silty sandstone of the Middle Member
of the Bakken Formation, approximately 10’ to 19’ below the Upper Shale of the Bakken
Formation.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic support of the Jefferies 5301 43-12B was provided by experienced RPM Well Site
Geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments
Bloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The
Bloodhound gas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas
detection to evaluate gases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the
surface by the drilling fluid.

The Bloodhound was interfaced with a RigWatch Drilling Recorder system. RigWatch
provided rate of penetration (ROP), on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and
received total gas information from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews caught lagged drill cutting samples at
30’ intervals from 8,300’ through 10,780’. Samples were logged at 10’ intervals during the
curve from 10,780’ to 11,050’. Throughout the lateral section, samples were continuously
logged at 30’ intervals until total depth 21,250’.

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in Entron critical cleaning solvent and inspected under a UV fluoroscope. Alizarin
red stain and ten percent hydrochloric acid were used to determine the calcareous and
dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.
