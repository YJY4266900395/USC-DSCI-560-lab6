Oasis will allocate production measured at the central production facility to the various wells on the basis of isolated
production tests utilizing oil, gas and water meters on a test seperator at the central production facility. Oasis will
measure the production from each well separately each month for a minimum of three days. Oasis believes that such
allocation will result in an accurate determination of production from each well. Tank vapor gas is being recovered
and burned by a 98% DRE enclosed combuster.
