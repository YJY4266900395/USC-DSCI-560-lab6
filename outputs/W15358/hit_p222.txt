Well File #15358
Dear Mr. Evertz:

Check No. M8897 in the amount of $100.00 was received. Enclosed find the approved
application for the above captioned well. It is requested that notification be given immediately
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of
spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.
Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020.

Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a
drilling reserve pit on this site if specific site conditions warrant. Also, please be advised
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a log from which the presence of cement
can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set.
Revisions to NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 effective September 1, 2000 require the operator to
run a Gamma Ray Log from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and that all
logs shall be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or
a format approved by the Director.

Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and
Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the
Director has given approval tor the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted
file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy
diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@saturn.ndic state nd us.

Thank you for your cooperation,

Sincerely,
KT/db Kelly Triplett
