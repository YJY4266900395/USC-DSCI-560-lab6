EVALUATION

GENERAL

The Nance Petroleum Corporation Lewis & Clark #2-4H was designed as a
horizontal outpost development well for the Nesson member of the Mississippian
Mission Canyon Formation within the Baker Field. The Baker Field is located in the
U.S. portion of the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Due to its
location on the Missouri River floodplain, a gravel pad was built up above the
surrounding ground elevation for the drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H and any
subsequent wells drilled from this location. The planned bottom hole location for the
initial lateral in the Lewis & Clark #2-4 was north and west of the surface location. Later
sidetracks may be added with different orientations.

The primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Lewis & Clark #2-
4H were :

1) the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. Basic Game & Fish #34-3 (now
owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.), with the surface location 392’ FSL
& 494’ FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,
N.D. The Basic Game & Fish was drilled directionally in late 1985 from
a pad in the SW SW Section 2 to a bottom hole location in the SE SE
Section 3. Completed in the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon
Formation, the original well produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG,
and 6,623’ BW through mid 2002. Nance re-entered the Basic Game
& Fish in November of 2003 and drilled a 3,800’ horizontal leg in the
Nesson. The bottom hole location of the horizontal leg was in the NE
SW Section 3, 1,975’ North and 4,338.8’ West of the surface location.
Recent production from the Nesson lateral has averaged 220 BOPD.

2) the John L. Cox French-Pinney #24-3 (now owned by Nance
Petroleum Corp.), located 660' FSL & 1,955’ FWL in the SE SW
Section 3, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,N.D. The French-Pinney
was drilled in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation
(Ordovician in age). The French-Pinney IP’d for 276 BOPD, 486
MCFG, and 0 BWPD, and has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456
MCFG, and 193,009 BW from the Red River.

3) The nearest well to the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is a dry hole drilled by
John L. Cox in 1989. The Mildred #1 was located 1,325’ FSL and 660’
FEL in the NE SE Section 4, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D. The
Mildred was drilled directionally to Red River depths, reaching a
bottom hole location 2,094.64’ FSL and 642.92’ FEL, still in the NE SE
Section 4. The Mildred was plugged and abandoned after
unsuccessfully testing the Nesson and the Red River.
