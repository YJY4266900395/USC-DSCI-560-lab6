Field are the Zinke & Trumbo, Inc. Foster #1-32 [200’ FNL, 700’ FWL,
NW NW Section 32, T154N, R101W, Williams Co., N.D.] and the
Davidson #1 [670 FSL, 1,970’ FWL SE SW Section 29, T154N,

The surface location for the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is 2,094! from the North line &
332' from the East line, in the Southeast quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 4,
Township 153 North, Range 101 West, McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
spudded with Nabors Drilling USA Rig #417 on April 13, 2003. Surface hole was drilled
with 13.75” bits and fresh water down to 3,008’. A string of 10.75” surface casing was
set and cemented at 3,008’. Drilling out of the surface casing commenced with 9.875”
bits and Invert Oil mud. Ice dams on the Missouri River caused flooding which
eventually threatened the location, therefore the drilling was suspended at 4,188’. The
drill string was tripped out and laid down and the derrick was laid over to await the
recession of the flood. The well was in suspense for 12 days. Drilling resumed after the
flood waters receded and the location and road dried out.

Drilling proceeded to the directional kick off point at 8,730’. A Baker Hughes
Inteq gyroscopic survey was made of the hole down to the kick off point to accurately
determine the starting point for directional operations. The results of the gyroscopic
survey placed the hole at 8,575’ at 35.4’ South and 38.3’ West of the surface location.
Baker Hughes Inteq provided directional supervision, and MWD with Gamma Ray for
the directional drilling operation. The first portion of the curve was built using 9.875” bits
down to a projected 70° at 9,224’ MD [Measured Depth]. A string of 7” and 7.625”
casing was run and cemented to 9,224’ MD. The drilling fluid was switched over to
fresh water with polymer sweeps for hole cleaning. The curve was drilled ahead with 6”
bits. The first mud motor out from intermediate casing under-performed both in
