Re: LEWIS & CLARK 2-4 PERMIT

Operations Plan

Dear Bob:

Enclosed is a copy of the final Muéti-Point Surface Use and Operations Plan for the Zinke
& Trumbo, Inc. Lewis & Clark 2-4 well.

Please review the Plan, sign and return three executed copies to me. I will then forward a
copy to the Corps of Engineers and Nance Petroleum.

Please note that under our Exhibit E: Cut and Fill Cross-Section, the diagram needs to be
changed to show the dikes at a total elevation at 1,858’. This coincides with our Multi-Point
Surface Use and Operations Plan. This may be modified when we file the State permit.

Background for your information

This draft has gone through extensive review with the Corps of Engineers, Nance
Petroleum, Zavanna, LLC and yourrepresentative, Rick Bumett. This is a workable plan for
the parties. After this Multi-Point Surface Use and Operations Plan is signed and returned
to the Corps, the Corps will issue a letter approving it and attaching it as an exhibit. Our
map will also be attached along with the letter.

Once the Corps has returned the letter, we will then assign the Lewis & Clark 2-4 permit
and Multi-Point Surface Use and Operations Plan to Nance (subject to our JOA and Corps
approval) dwho will sign off, ratifying and assuming the obligations under the permit.
