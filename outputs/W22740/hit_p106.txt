gtanted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the
notth & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of
Sections 13 & 24 T153N, R101W.

completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
