INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC. Larry 5301 44-12B [SE SE Sec. 12, T153N
R101W) is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles west of the town of Williston
in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Larry 5301 44-12B is a horizontal Middle
Bakken development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s Baker prospect within the
Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,246’.
The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Middle Bakken. This
well is a three section horizontal lateral which originates in the southeast quarter of
Section 12, then drilled south to land in northeast quarter of Section 13. The well bore
was steered south to the southeast of Section 25. (Figure 2) Directional drilling
technologies were used to land in the Middle Bakken Member reservoir and maintain
exposure to the target.
