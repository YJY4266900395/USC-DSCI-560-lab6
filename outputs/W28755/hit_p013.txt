INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R100W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 7T is a horizontal First Bench
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
ole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders
and 200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately
0,293’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the First Bench Three
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum is
targeting a dolomite and shale facies of the upper Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect
orosity and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
