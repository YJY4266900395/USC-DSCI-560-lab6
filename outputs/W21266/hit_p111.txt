RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
DAHL 15-11H
SWSE Section 11-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 21266

Dear RANDY:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14938, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east
& west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 2 & 11-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN WHILE DESIGNING THE FRAC
JOB FOR THE DAHL 15-11H WELL AS TO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SM ENERGY
LINDVIG 1-11HR WELL. Due to river adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. Also, a Closed Mud System may be required, although the disposal of drill cuttings is
contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field Inspector. SM ENERGY
CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours
