Baker Field
Well File No. 21266
STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Mr. Travis:

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (Oasis) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission
— Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on January 14, 2019 an application for a Stripper Well
Property Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and Oasis has elected to designate said well as a separate property
for stripper well purposes. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During
the qualifying period, August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017, the well produced at a maximum
efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold. The average daily
production from the well was 29.9 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is
applicable only to the Bakken Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

David J. McCusker

Petroleum Engineer
