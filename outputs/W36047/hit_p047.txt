Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot | Section 31, T153N, R100W]. The subject well is located approximately 8 miles south of the
town of Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR is
the fourth of four wells drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 pad. The subject well was drilled to replace
the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4B, which had drilled to kick off point before being plugged and abandoned.
This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 150’ E/W drilling setbacks. The
subject well is permitted to drill east from the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well
consists of a single Middle Bakken Member lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect
preferred porosity and fractures.
