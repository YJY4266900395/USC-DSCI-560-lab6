above is a centrifuge and is critical for maintaining mud
properties, Mud from the tank system will flow through the
centrifuge and the low gravity solids (cuttings) will drop out,
lowering the mud weight. (Brandon Hill, for Sunburst Consulting) |

INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum /-36-25H [SW SW SEC 36, T153N, R101 W] is located
~15 miles southwest of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
planned with one 9,183” long northbound leg with intent to intersect regional fracture trends that
might enhance reservoir quality within the Middle Bakken Member.

Directional tools were utilized to build a curve and [and within the 200’ legal setbacks of Section
36. A tangent was drilled prior to casing to cross the western hard line and set in the Middle
Bakken approximately 18’ below the Upper Bakken Shale. 7” intermediate casing was set at this
point to isolate the target reservoir. A single horizontal lateral in the Middle Bakken was
proposed to be drill into the NE % of NW 4 of Section 25.
