Summary

1) The Chalmer 5300 31-19H was initially spud for surface drilling on 1 September 2011 in
a Wildcat Field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud by Nabors 149
on 4 October 2011. The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,906’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.7 — 10.3 ppg) after surface casing and
through the curve build sections. Brine water with a weight of 9.9 to 10.3 ppg was used
during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance.

3) A 13 %” bit was used to drill to a depth of 1,915’. Two 8 %” Smith PDC bits were used
to drill out of surface casing to the KOP. Bit #1 drilled from a depth of 1,915” to 9,948’,
while Bit #2 drilled from 9,948” to 10,906’. The entire 10,352’ lateral was drilled in
120.5 hours with one 6” Smith PDC bit.

4) Gas levels between 2800 and 3400 units were maintained through most of the lateral
drilling operations.

5) The Middle Bakken consisted of two observed gross lithologies. Directly below the
upper Bakken Shale a light gray siltstone was observed. Below this siltstone, silty
sandstone ranging in colors from light to medium gray with occasional light tan to off
white color to a medium to dark gray was well sorted and very fine grained. The target
zone was comprised entirely of this silty sandstone.

6) A 3 to 5 foot flare was present intermittently at the stack through the lateral drilling
operation,

7) Abundant oil began washing out of the sample from a measured depth of approximately
11,800’ until TD at 20,300’, except where the well bore dipped below the bottom of the
target zone,

8) The Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated during horizontal drilling operations at a bottom
hole location of 62.66’ S and 2,803.34’ E of surface location, approximately 1,472.34’
FSL and 3,178.34” FWL NE SW Sec. 19, T153N, R100W, and forced the decision to
sidetrack at 13,000’.

9) Drilling operations were concluded at 0300 hours on 20 October 11 at a bottom hole
location of 134.57’ N & 9,825.31" E of surface location or approximately 1,669.57' FSL
& 313.06' FEL NE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R100W.

10) Oasis Petroleum Chalmers 5300 3]-19H awaits completion operations to determine its
ultimate production potential.
