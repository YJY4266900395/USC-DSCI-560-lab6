Measured Depth

Figure 7. Cross-sectional interpretation of the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H borehole based on lithology and
MWD gamma ray. The overall formation dip of 0.26° down resulted in a structural position at TD that was ~35”
lower in TVD than initial contact with the target zone (Kyle Kavalec, Sunburst well-site geologist)

SUMMARY

1) The Oasis Petroleum North America LLC, Inc. Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is a
continuation of exploratory efforts in McKenzie County, North Dakota targeting the
Middle Bakken porosity within the Miss.-Devonian Bakken Formation

2) The well was spud on July 27, 2011 and re-entered September 13, 2011. The vertical
hole was drilled to a kick-off point of 10,257’ on September 15, 2011. Intermediate
casing was set at 10,995’ MD in preparation for lateral operations. Lateral drilling
operations concluded on October 6, 2011.

3) The lateral was drilled with four 6” PDC bits.
4) A diesel invert mud program was used through the vertical and curve. Salt water
drilling fluid was used for the remainder of drilling operations. The weight of both

fluids was (~9.5-10.6 ppg) to maintain hydrostatic balance.

5) Samples from the Middle Bakken porosity consisted of silty sandstone and very fine
grained to fine grained sandstone with dolomite and calcite cement in part.
