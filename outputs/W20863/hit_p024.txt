INTRODUCTION

| Oasis Petroleum North America LLC, Inc. Foley Federal _42-12H [SW SE Section 12,
| T153N, R101W] is located approximately 10 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County,

North Dakota. The Foley Federal 530/ 43-12H is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the |
Williston Basin consisting of one ~9,425” long lateral drilled towards the north (360°). The

vertical hole was drilled to a depth of 10,257’ measured depth (MD). Plans called for a |
12°/100’ built rate in the curve to ensure landing within the Middle Bakken silty sandstone.

To isolate the targeted reservoir and meet legal requirements, intermediate casing was set

after drilling to 11,015’ MD (Figure 2). After intermediate casing had been set, directional

drilling and geo-steering techniques were employed to maintain maximum exposure to the

target reservoir.
