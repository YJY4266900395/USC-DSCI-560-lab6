Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was drilled from surface casing to
total depth in 19 days. A total depth of 20,940’ MD was achieved at 23:05 hours on May 13, 2019. The
well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target interval for 94% within target,
opening 9,725’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown
gray, light to medium gray, light brown, and off white silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very
fine grained. The middle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains.
Samples are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated
and nodular pyrite are present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown,
spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:

Maximum exposure to the target
Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
No shale strikes

No sidetracks

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.
