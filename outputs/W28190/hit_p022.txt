Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is in Baker Field of the Williston Basin [Lot
2 Section 31, T153N, R101 W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town of Williston,
in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is the second of two
wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown spacing
unit, with 500° N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from the
surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member lateral,
targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends enhancing reservoir
quality.

Engineering Operations Overview

The 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,328’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival.
Nabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 6, 2019. Due to the presence of several saltwater disposal
wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan
Kara and into the Swift. The 9 5/8” casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,145’. The remainder of the
vertical hole was completed with two 8 %4” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of
8,516’ before being replace due to low ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,327’
(KOP). The curve assembly consisted of a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#4), attached to a 2.38° NOV mud motor
and Scientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,240’ (casing point). The curve was successfully
landed at 11,240’ MD and 10,793’ TVD, approximately 17’ below the Upper Bakken Shale on May 9,
2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was then set to 11,215’ MD. The lateral assembly
consisted of a 6” Reed TKC53 PDC (#5) bit, attached to a 1.5° Discovery mud motor, and Scientific drilling
MWD tools. The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B reached a total depth of 20,940’ on May 13, 2019.
