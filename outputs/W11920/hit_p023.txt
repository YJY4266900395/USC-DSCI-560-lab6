STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Ms. Vogl:

St Mary Land & Exploration Company (St Mary) filed with the North Dakota Industrial
Commission — Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on February 2, 2009 an application for a
Stripper Well Property Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and St Mary has elected to designate said well as a separate property
for stripper well purposes. The well produccd from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During
the qualifying period, October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008 the well produced at a
maximum efficient rate and the average daily production from the well was 28.4 barrels of oil
per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is
applicable only to the Duperow Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
David J. McCusker

Petroleum Engineer
