ABSTRACT: An intensive cultural resource survey was conducted on the
area surrounding a proposed well pad and access road. No cultural
resources were found, and cultural clearance is recommended with no
special stipulations.

PROJECT LOCATION:

Agency: Corp of Engineers, Riverdale

USGS Quad: Williston SW (7.5')

Well Location: NW/NE (660 fnt, 2305 fel) Sec.10-T153N-R101W
Public Surface (5 acres surveyed)

Access Route: NH/NE Section 10
(0.11 miles surveyed, public surface)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction is planned on a well pad (est. 300 x
350°) and an access road (about 600 feet long). The access road leaves
the bladed county road just to the north and runs south on the west side
of an irrigation canal to the well location. The well pad and access
road are staked in a plowed field which is currently in stubble. This
flat area has been diked and is a controlled farming portion of the
wide Missouri River floodplain.
