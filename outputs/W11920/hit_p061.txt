Dear Ms. Magstadt:

Panterra Petroleum filed with the Industrial Commission on
March 7, 1996 an application for a Stripper Well Property
Determination for its Corps of Engineers #31-10 well (Well File
#11920, API #33-053~-02148) located in the NW NE 10-153N-101W,
McKenzie County, North Dakota.

Information contained in the application indicates that the
above mentioned well is a property pursuant to statute and rule,
and Panterra Petroleum has elected to designate said well as a
separate property for stripper well purposes. Also, the well
produces from a well depth of more than 10,000 feet. During the
twelve consecutive months qualifying period January 1995 thru
December 1995, the well produced at a maximum efficient rate, and
the average daily production from the well was 27.9 barrels of oil
per day.

It is therefore determined that the above mentioned well
qualifies as a "Stripper Well Property" pursuant to Section
57-51.1-01 NDCC.

This determination is applicable only to the Red River Pool
in and under sai@ property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall
have the authority to review the matter. The determination may be
amended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.

Sincerely,

dete 7 7
