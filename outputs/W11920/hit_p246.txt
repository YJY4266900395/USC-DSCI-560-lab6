MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN

BASIC EARTH SCIENCE SYSTEMS, INC.
Basic Corps of Engineers #31-10
NWiNE} Section 10, Township 153 North, Range 101 West
660' FNL - 2305' FEL (Surface Location)
660" FNL - 2140' FEL (Bottom Hole Location)
McKenzie County, North Dakota

SUMMARY OF PROJECT

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. is submitting the following application to
obtain permission from the Corps of Engineers to drill a 13,600 foot Red River
test with the above-referenced name and surface location. The location has
been carefully chosen to balance the concerns of Basic Earth Science Systems,
Inc., the Corps of Engineers, and surface lessee (North Dakota Game and Fish).
From this surface location Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. will
directionally drill to a legal bottom hole location of 660" FNL and 2140" FEL
of Section 10, T153N, R101W. All of the oil and gas minerals in this area are
privately owned. Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. understands that this
location is within the 100-year flood plain. Any facilities and equipment
“hich can be damaged by floodwater and which cannot be readily moved if a
flood is imminent will be placed at a location above, or adequately protected
by diking to 1858", the 100-year flood water surface elevation at this
location plus a minimum of three feet of freeboard to protect against wind-
wave runup. Due to lease constraints this well must be drilling by February
1, 1986, and, therefore, your expeditious processing of this application is
requested.
