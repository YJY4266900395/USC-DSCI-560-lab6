INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Sec. 18, T153N R1O00W]
is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles east of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Ash Federal 5300 11-18T is a horizontal Three Forks development
well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s Baker prospect (Baker Field) within the Williston Basin. The
vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,328’. The curve will be built at 12
degrees per 100’ to land within the upper Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which
originates in the northwest quarter of Section 18, then drills east to northeast quarter of Section
17 (Figure 2). Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques will be used to land
in the Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.
