INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T [Lot 2 Section 19,
T153N, R100W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the city of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T is a horizontal Three Forks well within
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,444' uncased lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical
hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,341’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees
per 100’ to land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the
northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Three Forks
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.
