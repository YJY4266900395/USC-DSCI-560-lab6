Summary

1) The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX was initially spud for surface drilling on 19th of
Sept 2014 in the Baker field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud by
Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,288’.

2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.95-11.4 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.9-10.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic
balance until a TD of 20,650’.

3) One 8 %4” Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of the intermediate Dakota casing to a
KOP of 10,288’. Two 8 %4” PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,125’ MD. One 6”
PDC bit was used to drill the lateral to 20,650’ TD.

4) The lateral was targeting the Middle Bakken member ranging from about 11° below the
base of the Upper Bakken Shale down to approximately 18’ above the Lower Bakken
Shale.

5) Gas levels between 100 and 1,000 units were maintained through the lateral drilling
operations while in the Middle Bakken, with higher gas levels apparent near the top of
the target window.

6) The Middle Bakken target consisted of one observed gross lithology. The Middle
Bakken was observed to be a silty sandstone with abundant disseminated pyrite and
apparent intergranular porosity.

7) Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

8) Drilling operations were concluded at 11:15 on Feb 17°, 2015 at a bottom hole location
of 560.34' S & 9,997.60' E of surface location or approx. 192.34' FNL & 254.55' FEL,
NE NE Sec. 20, T153N, R100W.

9) Exposure to target zone was ~95% of the lateral with 100% securely within the bounds of
the Middle Bakken member. Oasis Petroleum’s Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX awaits
completion operations to determine its ultimate production potential.
