DETAILS OF WORK
Nance Petroleum Corporation (NPC) requests approval to revise the direction of our horizontal lateral due to
acquired 3-D Seismic. The surface location will remain the same at 2094‘ FNL & 332’ FEL of Section 4, T153N, R101W.
The pay zone will be entered at 1641' FNL & 332’ FEL of Section 4, 7153, R101W. The proposed bottom bottom hole
location is 844"" FNL & 2043' FEL, Section 4, 153N, R101W. NPC also pians to drill a second lateral out of this well bore
by side tracking out of the casing below the base of the last Salt and drilling a curved lateral ending up with an
azimuth of 110 degrees. The pay zone will be entered at approximately 1790' FNL and 160' FEL of Section 4, T153N,
R101W. The proposed BHL is 2040"" FEL and 1800"" FNL of Section 3, T153N, R101W. The drilling of the second lateral
will be commenced by September 1, 2003. See the attached directional plan, drilling prognosis, and Survey Plats for
Section 3 & 4.
Should the captioned well be completed as a producer, NPC will escrow all royalty interests in an interest bearing
escrow account pending the NDIC's determination of a final spacing, proration unit. The working
interests have been pooled by agreement dated October 1, 2002.
NPC requests the well number be changed to 2-4H. ($25 check for attached)

DETAILS OF WORK
Continental Resources, Inc. requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in NDIC 43-02-03-21: Casing,
Tubing, and Cementing Requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming fracture
stimulation. The following assurances apply:
1) The well is equipped with 26#/ft P-110 7"" casing at surface with an API burst rating of 9960 psig for the 26 #/ft
casing.
2) The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 * API burst rating to determine the max pressure.
3) Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.
4) The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
5) The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates
6) Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.
7) A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period.
