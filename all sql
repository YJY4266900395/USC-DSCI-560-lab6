### 1. Select Database

```sql
USE oil_wells;
```

---

### 2. Total Rows in Wells

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM wells;
```

### 3. Check API Uniqueness

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT api_number) AS distinct_api FROM wells;

SELECT api_number, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM wells
GROUP BY api_number
HAVING cnt > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```

---

### 4. Wells Field Coverage

### 5. Sample Wells Records

```sql
SELECT api_number, well_name, operator, status, county, latitude, longitude, well_file_no
FROM wells

### 6. Figure1 Field Coverage

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  SUM(well_file_no IS NOT NULL AND well_file_no <> '') AS has_well_file_no,

  SUM(range_code IS NOT NULL AND range_code <> '') AS has_range,
  SUM(county IS NOT NULL AND county <> '') AS has_county
FROM wells;
```

### 7. Wells Missing Figure1 Fields

```sql
SELECT api_number, well_file_no, plss_quarter, section_no, township_code, range_code, county
FROM wells
WHERE well_file_no IS NULL
   OR plss_quarter IS NULL
   OR section_no IS NULL
   OR township_code IS NULL
   OR range_code IS NULL
   OR county IS NULL
ORDER BY api_number;
```

  SUM(oil_barrels IS NOT NULL) AS has_oil,
  SUM(gas_mcf IS NOT NULL) AS has_gas
FROM production_data;
```

---

### 10. Production Data Sample Join

```sql
SELECT w.api_number, pd.well_status, pd.well_type, pd.closest_city, pd.oil_barrels, pd.gas_mcf
FROM wells w
JOIN production_data pd ON pd.well_id = w.id
ORDER BY w.api_number
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### 11. Wells Missing Production Data

```sql
SELECT w.api_number
FROM wells w
LEFT JOIN production_data pd ON pd.well_id = w.id
WHERE pd.well_id IS NULL
ORDER BY w.api_number;
```

---

### 12. Total Rows in Stimulation Data

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS n FROM stimulation_data;
```

---

### 13. Figure2 Field Coverage

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  SUM(treatment_type IS NOT NULL AND treatment_type <> '') AS has_type,
  SUM(total_proppant IS NOT NULL) AS has_proppant,
  SUM(fluid_volume IS NOT NULL) AS has_fluid,
  SUM(max_pressure IS NOT NULL) AS has_pressure
FROM stimulation_data;
```

---

### 14. Stimulation Data Sample Join

```sql
SELECT w.api_number, w.well_file_no, sd.treatment_type, sd.total_proppant, sd.fluid_volume, sd.max_pressure
FROM wells w
JOIN stimulation_data sd ON sd.well_id = w.id
ORDER BY w.api_number
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### 15. Wells Missing Stimulation Data

```sql
SELECT w.api_number, w.well_file_no
FROM wells w
LEFT JOIN stimulation_data sd ON sd.well_id = w.id
WHERE sd.well_id IS NULL
ORDER BY w.api_number;
```

---

FROM wells w
JOIN stimulation_data sd ON sd.well_id = w.id
WHERE sd.treatment_type IS NULL
   OR sd.total_proppant IS NULL
   OR sd.fluid_volume IS NULL
   OR sd.max_pressure IS NULL
ORDER BY w.api_number;
```
