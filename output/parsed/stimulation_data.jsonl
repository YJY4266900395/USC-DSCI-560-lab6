If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we\nwill run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”\ncemented, to surface, tie back string.\nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.\nOur current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable\npackers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last\npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe – appx 130 ft. The\nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft\nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting\nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.\nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will\ncontinue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up\nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.\nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is\ncompleted on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then\nbacked off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.\nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner\npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to\n5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger.\nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for\ncompletion.\nShawn Svob\nDrilling Operat\n...[TRUNCATED]..."}

If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we\nwill run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”\ncemented, to surface, tie back string.\nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.\nOur current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable\npackers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last\npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe – appx 130 ft. The\nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft\nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting\nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.\nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will\ncontinue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up\nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.\nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is\ncompleted on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then\nbacked off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.\nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner\npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to\n5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger.\nTesters will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for\ncompletion.\nShawn Svob\nDrilling Operations Coordinator\n302 N.

If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we\nwill run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”\ncemented, to surface, tie back string.\nThe CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.\nOur current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable\npackers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last\npacker has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe – appx 130 ft. The\nliner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft\nabove KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting\nhigher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.\nRecently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will\ncontinue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up\nagainst the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.\nA push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is\ncompleted on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then\nbacked off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.\nImmediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner\npacker/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to\n5000 psi.
